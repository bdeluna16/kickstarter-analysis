* Based on the data below we can conlude the following:
  - On average, successful campaigns asked for $5,049 while failed campaigns asked for $10,554.00
  - On average, successful campaigns had $5,602 pledged to them while failed campaigns had $559.00 pledged to to them 
  - Failed kickstarter campaigns have a much higher fundraising goal than successful kickstarter campaigns
  - The mean & median pledged amounts of failed campaigns are much lower than the mean & median pledged amounts of successful campaigns. This is an indication that failed campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than requesting high goal amounts
