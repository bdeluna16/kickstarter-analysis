### Statistical Analysis
* Based on the data below we can conlude the following:
  - Failed kickstarter campaigns have a much higher fundraising goal than successful kickstarter campaigns
  - The mean & median pledged amounts of failed campaigns are much lower than the mean & median pledged amounts for successful campaigns. This is an indication that failed campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than requesting high goal amounts.
