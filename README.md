* Based on the data below we can conlude the following:
  - On average, successful campaigns asked for $5,049 while failed campaigns asked for $10,554.00
  - On average, successful campaigns had $5,602 pledged to them while failed campaigns had $559.00 pledged to to them 
  - Failed kickstarter campaigns have a much higher fundraising goal than successful kickstarter campaigns
  - The mean & median pledged amounts of failed campaigns are much lower than the mean & median pledged amounts of successful campaigns. This is an indication that failed campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than requesting high goal amounts

 ## Conclusion
 If Louise were to create a kickstarter campaign for her play we recommend the following based on the analyses above:
 * Kickstarter campaigns for theater/plays has the highest success rate out of all of the categories/subcategories in the given data. This is good news for Louise because her  campaign will have a higher probability of success. 
 * Based on the data of outcomes vs. launch date, Louise has the highest probability of a successful campaign if she launches it in either May or June. She should avoid launching one in November or December. Those months had the lowest amounts of successful campaings launched during those times. 
 * Looking at the statistics, we see that the average goal for successful campaigns in the U.S is $5,049.00. Louise is asking for $10,000.00 which is about twice the amount of the average goal. She should consider reducing the amount of money she asks for in order to create a greater probability of success.
