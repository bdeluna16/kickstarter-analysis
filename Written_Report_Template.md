# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
A playwriter named Louise created a kickstarter campaign in order to raise funds for her play "Fever". She came close to her fundraising goal in a short amount of time and now wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose
Analyze kickstarter campaign outcomes for the category "theater/play" based on launch date & fundraising goals. Our analysis will provide Louise insight on the performance of other campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
* The data in the graph is comprised of all "successful", "failed", and "canceled" kickstarter campaings in all countries from 2009-2017. 
* Looking at the trend line for theater outcomes based on launch date we can see that May and June have the highest number of successful kickstarter campaigns in the "theater" category. The trend line continually declines after June indicating a decrease in the amount of sucessful theater campaigns as the year goes on.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
